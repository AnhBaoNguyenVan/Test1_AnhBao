            <p>PWAs are web apps developed using a number of specific technologies and standard patterns to allow them
                to take advantage of both web and native app features.</p>

            <p>For example, web apps are more discoverable — it's a lot easier and faster to visit a website than
                install an application, and you can also share web apps via a link.</p>

                install an application, and you can also share web apps via a link.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, native apps are better integrated with the operating system and therefore offer a more
                seamless experience for the users. You can install a native app so that it works offline, and users love
                tapping their homescreen icons to easily access their favorite apps, rather than navigating to it using
                a browser.</p>

            <p> PWAs give us the ability to create web apps that can enjoy these same advantages.</p>

            <p>It's not a brand new concept — such ideas have been revisited many times on the web platform with various
                approaches in the past. Progressive Enhancement and responsive design already allow us to build mobile
                friendly websites. Working offline and installing apps was possible in the Firefox OS ecosystem a few
                years ago.</p>

            <p>PWAs, however, provide all this and more, without getting rid of any of the existing features that make
                the web great.</p>
